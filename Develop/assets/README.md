# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor README

## This is a readme file for my first homework assignment, Horiseon.

I built this project because I wanted to take Horiseon's website to the next level, offering accessibility to all potential viewers and a funtioning, beautiful webpage. To achieve my goal:

1. I first checked all links within the page and realized the first in the nav bar wasn't functional. I corrected this code within the HTML file by adding an id within the tag (please see comment within HTML file).
2. From there, I entered in alt tags to each of the images in order for screen-readers to pickup on what the image was.
3. I also changed the title to Horiseon so that if multiple tabs were open, it would be easier to find our page again.
4. I next cleaned the code by exchanging the non-semantic tags for semantic tags.
5. Grouping the identical CSS for multiple id's to a singular semantic tag was my next step.
6. Then finally, I cleaned up the CSS by removing certain fonts listed in the font-family that weren't necessary.

My hope is that not only does the functionality of the website after my edits cause my code to stand out, but the cleanliness of it to really shine as well.
